        A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME
    </h2>
    <p>
        Hey there! Welcome to my page. <br>
        I'm Joanna, a senior at Clarmeont Mckenna College studying psychology with a leadership sequence. <br>
        I was born and raised in Orange County, California. I don't plan on staying, but when I do leave, <br>
        the one thing I'll miss for sure is the food scene.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        My hometown is full of great restaurants that serve a beautiful array of dishes. <br>
        You can find practically anything here, from durian to birria tacos to Korean BBQ. There's always <br> 
        something new to try! 
    </p>
    <p>
        (Plus, my family is Korean, so you bet food is their love language!) <br>
        It goes without saying at this point that I love food. <br>
        I love consuming it, cooking with it, and watching others do the same. <br>
        I encourage you to rethink the way you see and enjoy food. Eating is more than an act of survival. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Here are some of my favorite recipes I've made it in the past! 10/10 all of them slap. <br>
        I want to talk about all of them, but I'm lazy, so I left comments for only the stand-out dishes.
    <br>
        If you make any of them, <span class="inform">let me know!</span> :)

        <li><a href="https://tiffycooks.com/the-best-kimchi-mac-and-cheese/"> Kimchi Mac n Cheese</a></li>
            <p>
                ~ I listed this one first for a reason. I made some for my boyfriend and his friends and they were all huge fans. <br>
                I've always liked mac n cheese, but most of the time, it's too rich; the cheesiness gets boring after a while. <br>
                This recipe is awesome because you're adding kimchi, Korean fermented cabbage. <br>
                Kimchi complements the richness of the cheese nicely and gives the whole dish a nice spicy kick. Kimchi is also good for your gut, <br>
                so you have one more reason to try it!

        <li><a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/golden-fried-rice/">Golden Fried Rice</a></li>
            <p>
                ~ Fried rice is already awesome on its own, but coating your rice in egg and tumeric elevates it to a whole new level. <br>
                If you want to make your fried rice taste like the one you order at a restaurant, here's a secret: get your pan smoking hot! <br>
                Once it's smoking, then add your rice. The grains will crisp instantly, giving it a smokier flavor.

                ~ This one is probably the hardest one to make, but it's definitely doable! <br>
                Where lots of peeople mess up is whipping the egg whites. You'll know when it's done <br>
                when you flip your mixing bowl over and the egg whites stay stuck. <br>
                That's how you get stiff peaks! :D
